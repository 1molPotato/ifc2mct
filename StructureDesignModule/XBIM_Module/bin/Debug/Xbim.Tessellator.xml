            Splice is the basic operation for changing the
            mesh connectivity and topology.  It changes the mesh so that
                eOrg->Onext = OLD( eDst->Onext )
                eDst->Onext = OLD( eOrg->Onext )
            where OLD(...) means the value before the meshSplice operation.
            
            This can have two effects on the vertex structure:
             - if eOrg->Org != eDst->Org, the two vertices are merged together
             - if eOrg->Org == eDst->Org, the origin is split into two vertices
            In both cases, eDst->Org is changed and eOrg->Org is untouched.
            
            Similarly (and independently) for the face structure,
             - if eOrg->Lface == eDst->Lface, one loop is split into two
             - if eOrg->Lface != eDst->Lface, two distinct loops are joined into one
            In both cases, eDst->Lface is changed and eOrg->Lface is unaffected.
            
            Some special cases:
            If eDst == eOrg, the operation has no effect.
            If eDst == eOrg->Lnext, the new face will have a single edge.
            If eDst == eOrg->Lprev, the old face will have a single edge.
            If eDst == eOrg->Onext, the new vertex will have a single edge.
            If eDst == eOrg->Oprev, the old vertex will have a single edge.

            Removes the edge eDel. There are several cases:

            Splice( a, b ) is best described by the Guibas/Stolfi paper or the

            Check the upper and lower edge of "regUp", to make sure that the
            eUp->Org is above eLo, or eLo->Org is below eUp (depending on which
            origin is leftmost).
            
            The main purpose is to splice right-going edges with the same
            dest vertex and nearly identical slopes (ie. we can't distinguish
            the slopes numerically).  However the splicing can also help us
            to recover from numerical errors.  For example, suppose at one
            point we checked eUp and eLo, and decided that eUp->Org is barely
            above eLo.  Then later, we split eLo into two edges (eg. from
            a splice operation like this one).  This can change the result of
            our test so that now eUp->Org is incident to eLo, or barely below it.
            We must correct this condition to maintain the dictionary invariants.
            
            One possibility is to check these edges for intersection again
            (ie. CheckForIntersect).  This is what we do if possible.  However
            CheckForIntersect requires that tess->event lies between eUp and eLo,
            so that it has something to fall back on when the intersection
            calculation gives us an unusable answer.  So, for those cases where
            we can't check for intersection, this routine fixes the problem
            by just splicing the offending vertex into the other edge.
            This is a guaranteed solution, no matter how degenerate things get.
            Basically this is a combinatorial solution to a numerical problem.

            Theoretically, this should always be true.  However, splitting an edge
            into two pieces can change the results of previous tests.  For example,
            suppose at one point we checked eUp and eLo, and decided that eUp->Dst

            into one.  "regUp" is the upper of these two regions.
            
            There are two reasons for doing this (adding a right-going edge):
             - if the two regions being merged are "inside", we must add an edge
               to keep them separated (the combined region would not be monotone).
             - in any case, we must leave some record of vEvent in the dictionary,
               so that we can merge vEvent with features that we have not seen yet.
               For example, maybe there is a vertical edge which passes just to
               the right of vEvent; we would like to splice vEvent into this edge.
            
            However, we don't want to connect vEvent to just any vertex.  We don''t
            want the new edge to cross any other edges; otherwise we will create
            intersection vertices even when the input data had no self-intersections.
            (This is a bad thing; if the user's input data has no intersections,
            we don't want to generate any false intersections ourselves.)
            
            Our eventual goal is to connect vEvent to the leftmost unprocessed
            vertex of the combined region (the union of regUp and regLo).
            But because of unseen vertices with all right-going edges, and also
            new vertices which may be created by edge intersections, we don''t
            know where that leftmost unprocessed vertex is.  In the meantime, we
            connect vEvent to the closest vertex of either chain, and mark the region
            as "fixUpperEdge".  This flag says to delete and reconnect this edge
            to the next processed vertex on the boundary of the combined region.
            Quite possibly the vertex we connected to will turn out to be the
            closest one, in which case we won''t need to make any changes.

            - the degenerate case: if vEvent is close enough to U or L, we
              merge vEvent into that edge chain.  The subcases are:
                - merging with the rightmost vertex of U or L

            Delete any degenerate faces with only two edges.  WalkDirtyRegions()
            will catch almost all of these, but it won't catch degenerate faces
            produced by splice operations on already-processed edges.
            The two places this can happen are in FinishLeftRegions(), when
            we splice in a "temporary" edge produced by ConnectRightVertex(),
            and in CheckForLeftSplice(), where we splice already-processed
            edges to ensure that our dictionary invariants are not violated
            by numerical errors.
            
            In both these cases it is *very* dangerous to delete the offending
            edge at the time, since one of the routines further up the stack
            will sometimes be keeping a pointer to that edge.

            <summary>
            TessellateMonoRegion( face ) tessellates a monotone region
            (what else would it do??)  The region must consist of a single
            loop of half-edges (see mesh.h) oriented CCW.  "Monotone" in this
            case means that any vertical line intersects the interior of the
            region in a single interval.  
            
            Tessellation consists of adding interior edges (actually pairs of
            half-edges), to split the region into non-overlapping triangles.
            
            The basic idea is explained in Preparata and Shamos (which I don't
            have handy right now), although their implementation is more
            complicated than this one.  The are two edge chains, an upper chain
            and a lower chain.  We process all vertices from both chains in order,
            from right to left.
            
            The algorithm ensures that the following invariant holds after each
            vertex is processed: the untessellated region consists of two
            chains, where one chain (say the upper) is a single edge, and
            the other chain is concave.  The left vertex of the single edge
            is always to the left of all vertices in the concave chain.
            
            Each step consists of adding the rightmost unprocessed vertex to one
            of the two chains, and forming a fan of triangles from the rightmost
            of two chain endpoints.  Determining whether we can add each triangle
            to the fan is a simple orientation test.  By making the fan as large
            as possible, we restore the invariant (check it yourself).
